## Phantom is the lightest blogging platform ever created.

Phantom has lightweight, readable code that has been carefully optimized for **extreme** traffic.
The default theme comes with a minimal flat design, that puts your content first.
Built from the ground up to maximize SEO with no extra work.

### Installation

Upload all of Phantom's files to the document root of your site.

### Editing

To get started, open index.html in your favorite text editor or IDE.

#### Custom Title

Replace the content of the `<title><title>` tag with a custom title that reflects the general
premise of your blog. This is also what shows in search engine results, so double check for typos!

#### Custom Header

Replace the content of the `<h1 id="header"></h1>` tag with your custom header text.

> **DO NOT ADD** any more `<h1>` tags or your site will not get any traffic, ever.

#### Custom Description

Replace the content of the `<div id="description"></div>` tag with your custom description text.

> Be sure to impress upon people who you want them to see you as, not who you actually are,
> because let's be honest, you are probably lame.

#### Posting Content

Adding new blog posts is **easy**.

Every post looks like this snippet:

	<div class="post">
		<h2 class="title">
			Post Title
		</h2>
		<div class="content">
			Post content.
		</div>
	</div>

Enter your content into the appropriate tags.

In order to add a second, third, fourth, etc post... simply copy and paste the post snippet
immediately above your last post and start typing.

#### Publishing Content

When you are done editing index.html, re-upload it to your site.
